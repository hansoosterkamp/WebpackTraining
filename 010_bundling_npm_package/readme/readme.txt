We're going to install 'axios', which is a library that issues web requests.
(we could have use fetch javascript or xmlhttprequest as well, but hey)
and then call the remote api to get a new joke whjenever the user presses 
the get another joke button

since the api is actually used within the application this is not a 
dev dependency, but an application dependency.

to install axios:

> npm i axios

in the generate joke we call the https://icanhhazdadjoke.com api using
axios
